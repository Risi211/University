Normalization:

Redundancy: duplicate values

Insert Anomaly: ex. We cannot insert a new University without students

Update Anomaly: ex. When we update the name of a student, we have to update all the rows that identify him

Deletion Anomaly: ex. If we want to delete an employee, we have to delete him from all the projects.


1NF:

each attribute is atomic, 
ex. sede (Milano, Roma, Napoli) is not 1NF

2NF:

each non-prime attribute depends completely from the primary key (not partially)
ex. Articolo, Magazzino, Quantità, Indirizzo
key: Articolo + Magazzino
Magazzino -> Indirizzo

It is not 2NF because of Indirizzo, we have to separate it into 2 tables.


3NF:

There are not transitive dependencies between non-prime attributes and the primary key

ex: IMPIEGATI(Imp_cod,Nome,Reparto,Capo_reparto)

Imp_cod -> Reparto -> Capo Reparto, this is not in 3NF



Boyce Codd:

for each X -> A dependency, X is a primary key

ex.

Prefisso, Telefono, Località, Nome
Key: Prefisso, Telefono

it is in 3NF but not in Boyce Codd, because of Località -> Prefisso


3NF = Boyce Codd if there is only 1 key attribute
